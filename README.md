P.S. We do not use databases (only files).
We use collections to store data in the program. In the process of processing
use Streams (or don't use them, if it's easier without them)
Note. Different manufacturers may have souvenirs with the same names. Example,
souvenir "Branded cup" can be obtained from the manufacturers "National University
shipbuilding" and "Privatbank".
